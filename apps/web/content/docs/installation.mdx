Bklit UI is a trusted registry for shadcn/ui. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Bklit UI components, make sure you have shadcn/ui set up in your project. If you haven't already, run:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

## Install Components

Install any Bklit UI component using the CLI:

<PackageManagerTabs name="area-chart" />

The registry is configured automatically — no manual setup needed. This will:
- Download the component source code
- Install any required dependencies
- Place files in your configured component directory
